# Arena Survivors

A *Vampire Survivors-like* game developed in **Godot 4.2**. This game started as a learning project following the [Create a Complete 2D Survivors Style Game in Godot 4](https://www.udemy.com/course/create-a-complete-2d-arena-survival-roguelike-game-in-godot-4/?couponCode=LETSLEARNNOW) course from Firebelley Games, though after finishing it I continued adding new features not included in the course.

## Features 

- Multiple levels connected by a central lobby.
- Survivors-like combat.
- Multiple enemies with different AI.
- Multiple temporal an permanent upgrades.
- Video and sound configuration.

## Assets
All assets used in this project are CCO.
Assets Packs by Kenney:
- Tiny Town
- Tiny Dungeon
- Tiny Ski

## Thanks
Thanks to Firebelley Games for making the course that allowed me to learn Godot and make my own games.
